# 0x01-variables_if_else_while
### This is a new project of c programming language, about:
 - Conditional statements.
 - Loops like for, while, do while.
 - Declaration of variables.
 - Type of variables.
 - Comments in c.
 - Identation.

### Arithmetic Operators in c:

|Operator	|	 Description						|	Example		|
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
|+ 		|Adds two operands.						|A + B = 30		|
|− 		|Subtracts second operand from the first.			|A − B = -10		|
|*		|Multiplies both operands.     	  				|A * B = 200		|
|/ 		|Divides numerator by de-numerator.  				|B / A = 2		|
|% 		|Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division.	|B % A = 0		|
|++ 		|Increment operator increases the integer value by one. 	|A++ = 11		|
|-- 		|Decrement operator decreases the integer value by one. 	|A-- = 9		|

### Logical Operators or boolean operators:

|   	    Operators  	      |			Example/Description					  |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|	&& (logical AND)      |(x>5)&&(y<5) It returns true when both conditions are true		  |
|	"||"(logical OR)      |(x>=10)||(y>=10) It returns true when at-least one of the condition is true|
|        ! (logical NOT)      |!((x>5)&&(y<5)) It reverses the state of the operand “((x>5) && (y<5))”If “((x>5) && (y<5))” is true, logical NOT operator makes it false|
